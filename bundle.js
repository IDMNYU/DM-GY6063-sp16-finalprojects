/**
 * Creates colors for storing in variables of the color datatype. The
 * parameters are interpreted as RGB or HSB values depending on the
 * current colorMode(). The default mode is RGB values from 0 to 255
 * and, therefore, the function call color(255, 204, 0) will return a
 * bright yellow color.
 * <br><br>
 * Note that if only one value is provided to color(), it will be interpreted
 * as a grayscale value. Add a second value, and it will be used for alpha
 * transparency. When three values are specified, they are interpreted as
 * either RGB or HSB values. Adding a fourth value applies alpha
 * transparency. If a single string parameter is provided it will be
 * interpreted as a CSS-compatible color string.
 *
 * Colors are stored as Numbers or Arrays.
 *
 * @method color

  /**
   * Called directly before setup(), the preload() function is used to handle
   * asynchronous loading of external files. If a preload function is
   * defined, setup() will wait until any load calls within have finished.
   * Nothing besides load calls should be inside preload (loadImage,
   * loadJSON, loadFont, loadStrings, etc).
   *
   * @method preload
   * @example
   * <div><code>
   * var img;
   * var c;
   * function preload() {  // preload() runs once
   *   img = loadImage('assets/laDefense.jpg');
   * }
   *
   * function setup() {  // setup() waits until preload() is done
   *   img.loadPixels();
   *   // get color of middle pixel
   *   c = img.get(img.width/2, img.height/2);
   * }
   *
   * function draw() {
   *   background(c);
   *   image(img, 25, 25, 50, 50);
   * }
   * </code></div>

  /**
   * The setup() function is called once when the program starts. It's used to
   * define initial environment properties such as screen size and background
   * color and to load media such as images and fonts as the program starts.
   * There can only be one setup() function for each program and it shouldn't
   * be called again after its initial execution.
   * <br><br>
   * Note: Variables declared within setup() are not accessible within other
   * functions, including draw().
   *
   * @method setup
   * @example
   * <div><code>
   * var a = 0;
   *
   * function setup() {
   *   background(0);
   *   noStroke();
   *   fill(102);
   * }
   *
   * function draw() {
   *   rect(a++%width, 10, 2, 80);
   * }
   * </code></div>
   */

  /**
   * Called directly after setup(), the draw() function continuously executes
   * the lines of code contained inside its block until the program is stopped
   * or noLoop() is called. Note if noLoop() is called in setup(), draw() will
   * still be executed once before stopping. draw() is called automatically and
   * should never be called explicitly.
   * <br><br>
   * It should always be controlled with noLoop(), redraw() and loop(). After
   * noLoop() stops the code in draw() from executing, redraw() causes the
   * code inside draw() to execute once, and loop() will cause the code
   * inside draw() to resume executing continuously.
   * <br><br>
   * The number of times draw() executes in each second may be controlled with
   * the frameRate() function.
   * <br><br>
   * There can only be one draw() function for each sketch, and draw() must
   * exist if you want the code to run continuously, or to process events such
   * as mousePressed(). Sometimes, you might have an empty call to draw() in
   * your program, as shown in the above example.
   *
   * @method draw
   * @example
   * <div><code>
   * var yPos = 0;
   * function setup() {  // setup() runs once
   *   frameRate(30);
   * }
   * function draw() {  // draw() loops forever, until stopped
   *   background(204);
   *   yPos = yPos - 1;
   *   if (yPos < 0) {
   *     yPos = height;
   *   }
   *   line(0, yPos, width, yPos);

 * The push() function saves the current drawing style settings and

 * information. The push() and pop() functions can be embedded to provide
 * more control. (See the second example for a demonstration.)

 * push() stores information related to the current transformation state
 * and style settings controlled by the following functions: fill(),
 * stroke(), tint(), strokeWeight(), strokeCap(), strokeJoin(),
 * imageMode(), rectMode(), ellipseMode(), colorMode(), textAlign(),
 * textFont(), textMode(), textSize(), textLeading().

 * These values are numbers. This array is the size (include an appropriate
 * factor for pixelDensity) of the display window x4,
 * representing the R, G, B, A values in order for each pixel, moving from
 * left to right across each row, then down each column. Retina and other
 * high denisty displays will have more pixels[] (by a factor of
 * pixelDensity^2).
 * For example, if the image is 100x100 pixels, there will be 40,000. On a
 * retina display, there will be 160,000.
 * <br><br>
 * The first four values (indices 0-3) in the array will be the R, G, B, A
 * values of the pixel at (0, 0). The second four values (indices 4-7) will
 * contain the R, G, B, A values of the pixel at (1, 0). More generally, to
 * set values for a pixel at (x, y):
 * <code><pre>
 * var d = pixelDensity;
 * for (var i = 0; i < d; i++) {
 *   for (var j = 0; j < d; j++) {
 *     // loop over
 *     idx = 4 * ((y * d + j) * width * d + (x * d + i));
 *     pixels[idx] = r;
 *     pixels[idx+1] = g;
 *     pixels[idx+2] = b;
 *     pixels[idx+3] = a;
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre></code>
 *
 * <p>While the above method is complex, it is flexible enough to work with
 * any pixelDensity. Note that set() will automatically take care of
 * setting all the appropriate values in pixels[] for a given (x, y) at
 * any pixelDensity, but the performance may not be as fast when lots of
 * modifications are made to the pixel array.
 * <br><br>
 * Before accessing this array, the data must loaded with the loadPixels()
 * function. After the array data has been modified, the updatePixels()
 * function must be run to update the changes.

 *  <p>The default behavior is to save the canvas as an image. You can
 *  optionally specify a filename.
 *  For example:</p>
 *  <pre class='language-javascript'><code>
 *  save();
 *  save('myCanvas.jpg'); // save a specific canvas with a filename

 *  an Array of JSON, a JSON object, a p5.Table, a p5.Image, or a
 *  p5.SoundFile (requires p5.sound). The second parameter is a filename
 *  (including extension). The third parameter is for options specific
 *  to this type of object. This method will save a file that fits the
 *  given paramaters. For example:</p>
 *
 *  <pre class='language-javascript'><code>
 *

 *
 *  var cnv = createCanvas(100, 100);

 *
 *  var gb = createGraphics(100, 100);
 *  save(gb, 'myGraphics.jpg');      // Saves p5.Renderer object as an image
 *
 *  save(myTable, 'myTable.html');  // Saves table as html file
 *  save(myTable, 'myTable.csv',);  // Comma Separated Values
 *  save(myTable, 'myTable.tsv');   // Tab Separated Values
 *
 *  save(myJSON, 'my.json');        // Saves pretty JSON
 *  save(myJSON, 'my.json', true);  // Optimizes JSON filesize
 *
 *  save(img, 'my.png');            // Saves pImage as a png image

/**
 * Returns the Perlin noise value at specified coordinates. Perlin noise is
 * a random sequence generator producing a more natural ordered, harmonic
 * succession of numbers compared to the standard <b>random()</b> function.
 * It was invented by Ken Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in
 * graphical applications to produce procedural textures, natural motion,
 * shapes, terrains etc.<br /><br /> The main difference to the
 * <b>random()</b> function is that Perlin noise is defined in an infinite
 * n-dimensional space where each pair of coordinates corresponds to a
 * fixed semi-random value (fixed only for the lifespan of the program; see
 * the noiseSeed() function). p5.js can compute 1D, 2D and 3D noise,
 * depending on the number of coordinates given. The resulting value will
 * always be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be animated by moving
 * through the noise space as demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd
 * and 3rd dimension can also be interpreted as time.<br /><br />The actual
 * noise is structured similar to an audio signal, in respect to the
 * function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics in
 * physics, perlin noise is computed over several octaves which are added
 * together for the final result. <br /><br />Another way to adjust the
 * character of the resulting sequence is the scale of the input
 * coordinates. As the function works within an infinite space the value of
 * the coordinates doesn't matter as such, only the distance between
 * successive coordinates does (eg. when using <b>noise()</b> within a
 * loop). As a general rule the smaller the difference between coordinates,
 * the smoother the resulting noise sequence will be. Steps of 0.005-0.03
 * work best for most applications, but this will differ depending on use.
